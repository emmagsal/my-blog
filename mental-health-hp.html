        My aim with this page is for it to become a safe space for people who are
        looking for reassurance that they are not alone in their feelings. When I
        first started to struggle with <a href="">anxiety</a>, I didn't even know
        that was it's name. I have had memories mixed in with feelings of "fear"
        for as long as I can remember.
        <br />
        <br />
        From a young age my body would confuse feelings of excitement, with fear
        and anxiety. I hope that over time, I can share with you, some of the
        lessons I have learnt. In my later years I realised that I was also
        battling periods of low mood. Towards the tail end of the UK lockdowns, I
        suffered with my worst bout of mental health struggles. My doctor
        diagnosed me with <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/overview/">"Generalised Anxiety Disorder"</a>
        <br />
        <br />
        During this time I felt very alone in my experience, in the previous years
        I felt I had a lid on these struggles, or if they bubbled up, I knew how
        to calm myself. This time was different. I didn't feel incontrol at all.
        I'll be honest, it scared the hell out of me.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am sharing all of this, so that if you are struggling at the moment, you
        can read from someone who gets it, whose been through it, and is out the
        other side of it. My hope is that I can comfort you, and bring some light
        to you.
